# Ã‰loÃ¯s SANCHEZ

I am a full stack developer with a preference for backend.

## Languages

My favorite language is **Rust**, I've been using it daily for 5 years and as soon as I can I do everything in **Rust**, including the front end.

I also have a good grasp of :

* Typescript (with Angular andÂ nodeJs)
* Dart (with Flutter)
* Java (with Spring boot)

I also have some knowledge in bash and python, mainly for scripting deployment processes.

## Main project

I'm mainly working on [Duniter]: a blockchain-based P2P crypto-currency engine with Web of Trust.

Most of my contributions are on the self-hosted gitlab: [git.duniter.org](https://git.duniter.org)

In particular, I'm working on the migration of [Duniter] to [subtrate]: see [Duniter-v2s].

## Other Contributions

* I contributed to the [async_lock] crate.
* I am the creator and maintainer of the [fast-threadpool] and [pkstl] crates.

## ðŸ“« How to reach me:

* Mail: `c` at `elo` dot `tf`
* I am present on the free and decentralized messaging system XMPP: [elois@duniter.org](xmpp:elois@duniter.org?join)
