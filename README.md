# Ã‰loÃ¯s SANCHEZ

I am a full stack developer with a preference for backend.

## Languages

My favorite language is **Rust**, I've been using it daily for 6 years and as soon as I can I do everything in **Rust**, including the front end.

I also have a good grasp of :

* Typescript (with Angular andÂ nodeJs)
* Dart (with Flutter)
* Java (with Spring boot)

I also have some knowledge in bash and python, mainly for scripting deployment processes.

## Main project

Since 2021, I'm mainly working on [Moonbeam]: An Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot.

In particular, I'm working on the development and maintenance of the blockchain protocol itself (in Rust). I am also the maintainer of the github actions of the project.

For the needs of Moonbeam, I am regularly lead to contribute to [Substrate], [Cumulus] and [Frontier].

## Past project

From 2017 to 2021, I'm worked mainly on [Duniter]: a blockchain-based P2P crypto-currency engine with Web of Trust.

Most of my contributions are on the self-hosted gitlab: [git.duniter.org](https://git.duniter.org).

In particular, I'm worked on the migration of [Duniter] to [Substrate]: see [Duniter-v2s].

## Other Contributions

* I contributed to the [async_lock] crate.
* I am the creator of the [fast-threadpool] and [pkstl] crates.
